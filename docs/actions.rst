What are actions?
=================

Sometimes, you will need input user name and password to login, or give a query string to begain a search. ScrapeConfig can't do this by default. So we add a functionality called "Action" to ScrapeConfig, like Selenium IDE, user interaction with current page such as mouse click, keyboard input can be recorded as Action, and will be playback when crawling is started.  

.. _what-are-annotations:

What are commands?
=====================

Action has a sequences of commands, which hold event that user triggers, such as mouse click or keyboard input, and so on. Each command has three properties: Event, Target and Value. Event is name of event issued by user,  there are only two type of event ('click' and 'input') are supported now. Target is selector to the element which Event is about, and Value is the parameters of Event, for example, Value of 'click' is the coordinates of the click,  and value of 'input' is the string content of user input. 

Commands
===========

Recording commands
--------------------


When Action was created, you can begin to record commands by click |icon-record| button, any event user triggered will be saved and displayed at commands area of Action in left siderbar.  When all event was recorded, you can stop recoding by click |icon-stop-record| button. 

Commands can be record accumulatively, this means when you click |icon-record| button again, the new commands record will be append to old ones.
